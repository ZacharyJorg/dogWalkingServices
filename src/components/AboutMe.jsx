        Hello! My name is Zachary Jorgensen, I've been a Temecula resident and
        community member for over 20 years and a dog lover for as long as I can
        remember. The last couple years I found walking to be exponentially
        beneficial to my mental health and helped me connect with my local area,
        all while having my favorite girl next to me, my 4 year old yorkie,
        Penny. We have walked nearly everyday in the last 3 years and ive seen
        how much she benefits from being able to see other dogs, people and
        interact with the world around her. Dont just take it from Penny, I've
        worked with and taken care of, walked, played and stated with a wide
        range of dog breeds in all shapes and sizes. Given our tight community
        here, I would love the opportunity to give back and provide help to my
        neighbors by giving their pets their daily enjoyment or even an
        overnight sleeping buddy to help eliveate some of the stressors of
        owning a pet.
